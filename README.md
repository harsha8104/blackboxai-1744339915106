# Traffic Simulation System

## Project Overview

The Traffic Simulation System is a comprehensive simulation environment designed to model and analyze traffic behavior using SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) and TraCI (Traffic Control Interface). This application integrates various components, including a machine learning (ML) layer for traffic prediction, a camera emulation layer for real-time data capture, and a visualization dashboard to display simulation metrics. The goal is to optimize traffic signals based on real-time data, improving overall traffic flow and reducing congestion.

## Installation

To set up the Traffic Simulation System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic_sim.git
   cd traffic_sim
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure that you have SUMO and TraCI installed. Then install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure your environment:**
   Edit `config/simulation_config.yaml` and `config/ml_config.yaml` to adjust simulation and ML parameters as needed.

## Usage

1. **Run the simulation:**
   Launch the application by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Access the visualization dashboard:**
   The Streamlit dashboard will be accessible at `http://localhost:8501` where you can monitor real-time traffic metrics and control the simulation.

## Features

- **Traffic Simulation:** Models traffic flow and vehicle interactions using SUMO.
- **Real-time Data Capture:** Emulates camera systems to collect traffic data.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Predicts traffic congestion and optimizes signal timings based on historical data.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Provides a user-friendly interface for real-time visualization of traffic metrics and system controls.
