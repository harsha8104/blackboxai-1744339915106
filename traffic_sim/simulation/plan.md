# Traffic Simulation Enhancement Plan

## Objectives
- Improve logging functionality to capture more detailed simulation events.
- Add new features for enhanced traffic metrics analysis.

## Proposed Changes

1. **Enhance Logging**:
   - Modify the logger to include more detailed information about vehicle movements and camera detections.
   - Log warnings for any anomalies detected during the simulation.

2. **New Traffic Metrics**:
   - Implement additional metrics such as average waiting time at intersections and vehicle stop counts.
   - Create a method to visualize traffic data over time.

3. **Camera Enhancements**:
   - Improve the camera detection algorithm to reduce false positives in vehicle detection.
   - Add functionality to track vehicle types (e.g., cars, trucks) for more granular metrics.

4. **User Configuration**:
   - Allow users to specify logging levels and output formats through the configuration file.
   - Enable toggling of specific metrics in the configuration file.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update the documentation to reflect new features and usage instructions.

## Next Steps
- Review the proposed changes with the team.
- Prioritize features based on user feedback and performance metrics.
